dugad/dugad.m
Implements Dugad's additive and blind watermarking algorithm.

inoue/IN2.m
Inoue, method B, watermarking algorithm. The same watermark is
embedded into the detail subbands of the wavelet transform. 
The user selects which subbands to use for watermark insertion.
Quantization based.

novel/IN7.m
The novel watermarking method. Unlike the Inoue system, this system
works blindly (doesn't require a position file in order to recover
the watermark). Can survive the same attacks as the
Dugad watermarking system, but does not degrade the marked image 
to the same extent. Quantization based.
