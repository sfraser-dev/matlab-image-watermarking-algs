# MATLAB Watermarking algorithms   

dugadInoueNovel/ directory
This directory has 3 different watermarking algorithms for MATLAB (dugad, inoue and novel).
The paper for the novel algorithm is on my website.
It and the other two are described in chapter 7 of my thesis (starts on page 115).
The Inoue (page 72) and the Dugad (page 44) algorithms are also described in Meerwalds thesis (see below).

These 4 watermarking MATLAB programs require WaveLab from stanford university to be installed, see
